## üß† Abstract

This project investigates the automated classification of respiratory sounds using deep learning. It evaluates three architectures‚Äî**CustomCNN**, **ResNet50**, and **DenseNet121**‚Äîon spectrogram representations of auscultation recordings. Despite promising general performance from transfer learning models, the results highlight ongoing challenges in class imbalance and rare class detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### üîä Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Resampling**: All audio signals downsampled to 4kHz.
- **Baseline Removal**: DFT-based filtering (K=8) removes low-frequency noise.
- **Windowing**: 5-second segments with 50% overlap.
- **Augmentation**: White noise injection, pitch shift, time shift.
- **Spectrograms**: Log-mel spectrograms of size 224√ó224.

### üß© Models
- **CustomCNN**: 3-layer convolutional network trained from scratch.
- **ResNet50**: Pretrained on ImageNet, adapted for 1-channel inputs.
- **DenseNet121**: Pretrained with dense blocks and feature reuse.
- **CORAL** (optional): Domain adaptation via covariance alignment.

### üèãÔ∏è Training & Evaluation
- Loss: Weighted `CrossEntropyLoss`
- Optimizer: `AdamW` or `SGD`
- Scheduler: `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Metrics: Accuracy, Macro F1-score, ROC AUC
- Early Stopping: after 6 epochs of stagnation

## üí° Recommendations

- Apply **focal loss** or **class-balanced loss** to improve rare class detection.
- Introduce **GANs** or **SMOTE** for data augmentation in underrepresented classes.
- Explore **threshold calibration** and **DANN** (adversarial domain adaptation).
- For deployment, consider **model compression** and **quantization**.
