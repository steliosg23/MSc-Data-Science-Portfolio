# Data Science Challenge ‚Äì INF342: Product Classification on Amazon

**Course**: Practical Data Science  
**Program**: MSc in Data Science, Athens University of Economics and Business  
**Project**: INF342 ‚Äì Product Classification Challenge

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of the project was to develop a classification model for Amazon sports products using **graph structure**, **textual descriptions**, and **metadata**. The dataset included product relationships (co-viewed graph), product titles, descriptions, prices, and category labels.

---

## üîß Methodology

The classification task was approached using:

- **Text Preprocessing**: TF-IDF vectorization of product descriptions and titles.
- **Graph Features**: Computation of centrality metrics and PageRank from the product co-viewed network.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Truncated SVD for compressing text embeddings.
- **Feature Engineering**: Merging graph-based and textual features.
- **Modeling**: Training ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost) and logistic regression for multi-class classification.
- **Evaluation**: Using accuracy, macro-F1, and confusion matrix to assess performance.

---

## üìä Results

- Best model achieved:
  - **Accuracy**: ~82%
  - **Macro F1-score**: ~0.79

The combination of **graph embeddings + textual features** yielded superior results compared to using either individually.
